  I've started this project a while back, but never
  finished it. Starting now I currently have HTML
  score interface, with buttons to chose cross or
  circle and the playfield along with symbols (X, O).
  I've added style with CSS and some functionality
  with JS (player selection and showing symbol on
  the board).

  Things to do:

  - Alternate between player and computer picks (partially done)
  - End when someone wins
  - End when grid is full ✔
  - Update the scoreboard
  - Start new round ✔
