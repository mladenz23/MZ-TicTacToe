# MZ-TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe game with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS

It's a basic tic tac toe game, where user can pick
cross or circle and then play against computer.
Game keeps score of the winnings.

  I've started this project a while back, but never
  finished it. Starting now I currently have HTML
  score interface, with buttons to chose cross or
  circle and the playfield along with symbols (X, O).
  I've added style with CSS and some functionality
  with JS (player selection and showing symbol on
  the board).

  Things to do:

  - Alternate between player and computer picks ✔
  - End when someone wins ✔
  - End when grid is full ✔
  - Update the scoreboard ✔
  - Start new round ✔
  - Add random picking by NPC ✔
  - Fix bugs:
    - npc move being made after player wins the game
    - score updates by 2 after player win (probably
      has something to do with the first bug)
